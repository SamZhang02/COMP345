### Problem 2.2

What is the CQL query for modifiers of covid (all forms)?

```cql
[tag="JJ"] [word="(?i)covid(-|\s)?(\d+)?"]
```

Include the snapshot of the 20 most frequent modifiers modifiers:

\newpage

What is the CQL query for words that occur in right coordination with Covid (all forms) (e.g., in Covid-19 , SARS-2002 , and HCoV-NL63, the words iSARS-2002 and HCoV-NL63 are the right conjuncts/coordinates).

```cql
[tag="N.*" & (word !="(?i)covid(-|\s)?(\d+)?('s)?")] within 
[word="(?i)covid(-|\s)?(\d+)?"] ([tag="CC" | word=","][(tag="N.*")]){0,9999}
```

Include the snapshot of those words:

What is the CQL query for verbs that can take Covid (all forms) as subject?

```cql
[word="(?i)covid(-|\s)?(\d+)?"][]{0,2}[(tag != "VH.* | VB.*") & (tag = "VV.*")]
```

Include the snapshot of verbs that take Covid as subject:

\newpage

What is the CQL query for verbs that can take Covid (all forms) as object?

```cql
[(tag ="V.*")&(tag!="VB.*|VH.*")][]{0,2}[word="(?i)covid(-|\s)?(\d+)?"]
```

Include the snapshot of verbs that take Covid as object:

### Problem 2.3

For this corpus, the LogDice score appears to be the most effective metric for identifying and ranking collocations
The ranking from Mutual Information (MI) score is unique but prioritizes rare word combinations ($\le 10$ co-occurrences). This characteristic of MI can lead to highlighting less frequent, therefore potentially less relevant collocations in the context of a prevalent and significant term like "COVID."

The T-Score, places emphasis on more common words such as "of" In this specific corpus, these common words provide relatively minimal informational value about the unique linguistic patterns associated with COVID-19.

The LogDice score offers a more balanced result. It appear to effectively normalize the frequency of word pairs and addresses the biases towards extremely rare or extremely common words. This produced good results, where overly common words and overly scarse words are ranked lower. Among all three rankings, the LogDice score gives more nuanced and contextually relevant ranking of collocations that balances statically significance and content richness well.
